Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) - Instant Noodles Supply Optimization
Overview
This project aims to address the supply-demand mismatch faced by a Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) company in the instant noodles business. The company's management has observed inconsistencies between demand and supply, leading to inventory cost and overall losses. The goal is to create a model using historical data to optimize the supply quantity from each warehouse across the country.

Goals
1. Conduct comprehensive data science tasks including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and visualization.
2. Identify trends and insights within the data to inform decision-making.
3. Highlight potential next steps and areas for improvement in the modeling process.
4. Apply 5 to 6 machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance using a separate test dataset.

Project Structure
Data Exploration: Analyze and visualize the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features, relationships, and trends.
Data Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Model Development: Implement various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR, and KNeighbors to predict the optimum product weight.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of each model using evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate model predictions, feature importance, and comparison between models.
